## Grant Access to new User

### Step 1

If you are a new user, please go ahead and create this ticket, and then 
contact @mllabai with a link to the ticket so we can approve it.

### Step 2
Fill out the following fields

* Project Name:
* GitHub Org: FG-AI4H
* New user's GitHub ID: @
* Reason to access:

### Step 3
For security and privacy reasons, please send the following information by email to ml@mllab.ai:

* New user's GitHub ID
* New user's email address associated with the GitHub account
* New user's organization (gov ministry plus division,branch,etc.) or company
* New user's role on the project (e.g. Developer, QA, DevOps specialist, Scrum Master)
* GitHub repositories if exist
* Expiry (optional) - it is the team's responsibility to remove users from the repo when they no longer require it.

**Note** that the Platform Services Team will be removing GitHub Org access **automatically** for users that are not active for six months. Once the access has been removed, a new `Access Request` has to be made by the product owner.
